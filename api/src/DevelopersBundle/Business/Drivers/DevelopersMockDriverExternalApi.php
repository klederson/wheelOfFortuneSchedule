/**
 * Driver
 *
 * This is just to exemplify the possibility of having different business rules (payment methods, payment providers,
 * gateways for example) without the need to tear apart your business logic because of them.
 *
 * Using this architecture your code is more open for changes and evolution without bringing huge disturbs to your whole
 * application.
 *
 * In this case I just choose to abstract the source of data for Developers in different ways ( Api, Static CSV file,
 * Static Json file, Database using Doctrine, Database using MongoDB, Efemeral sources like Redis or Memcached could
 * also be used - even tho this last two could be ugly practices for this purpose).
